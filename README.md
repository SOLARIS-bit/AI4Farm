# 🌱 AI4Farm – Soil Health Estimator

AI4Farm is a simple prototype designed to help small farmers estimate the health of their soil using basic inputs and AI-inspired logic.

This project was created as part of the **MIT Solve Challenge** and the **C1 English Project** at aivancity.

---

## 🚀 Demo

A live demo will be available once deployed to **Streamlit Cloud**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Smallholder farmers often lack access to expensive soil testing services.  
AI4Farm uses **simple rules**, **open data**, and **user input** to provide a quick estimation of soil health.

This prototype:
- Takes 3 simple inputs (soil color, moisture, crop type)
- Computes a Soil Health Score out of 100
- Gives practical advice to the user

It is not a scientific soil test — but a **conceptual demo** showing how AI could support sustainable agriculture.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Built with **Python + Streamlit**
- Uses simple scoring logic emulating a basic AI model
- Runs in the browser with no installation needed

---

## ▶️ Run Locally

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
````

The app will open automatically in your browser.
